# memememe

This project started with the suspicion that phones are having more fun communicating than we are. Every message is a tickle, every swipe a little rub.

From their initial transformation of metal and silicon into objects of desire, infused with social significance and “intelligence”, personalized with biases and ideology, endowed with a flawless memory, always a call away from the mothership… it becomes difficult to declare who – phone or human – has the more complex cultural heritage.

memememe is a sculpture that celebrates the ambiguities of human/object, user/interface and actor/network relationships. It is an app that removes phones from their anthropocentric usefulness, and gives them the beginnings of a language. Residues of their conversations can be seen, but certainly not understood.
